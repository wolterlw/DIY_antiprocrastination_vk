# DIY_antiprocrastination_vk
antiprocrastination vk.com client using vkApi

to use this client you have to get an access token

TODO: implement this thing using a bash script later on
TODO: access token should be placed in a text file like this {"token": "<your token>"}

then use by
python client.py <path to file with token>
